# New Portfolio

Welcome to my newly designed web portfolio! 

There comes a time in every developers life when he/she/uncertain wants to present the fruit of his/her/this_is_hard labor to the world, and such a time came for me. 
My old portfolio was crumbling down from poor javascript architecture and unorganised css code. It was so beautiful at the beginning, but over time it turned every developers worst nightmare.
So I decided to take matters into my own hands and put an end to this nonsense once and for all. 

This portfolio was made using :

1. HTML
   - even though this might seem like the easiest out of all, it was pretty interesting to read about the concept of semantic HTML. 
   - I really wanted to learn how to organise my HTML and use its simple structure to my advantage. 
   - I still suffer from divification, everything is a div, but that's because it's easier for me to work that way in an HTML setting. 
   - despite the obvious simple nature of this tool, I was eager to learn more about best practices 
   
2. SCSS
   - I like to think I am fairly strong in the CSS domain, but I have never dabbled too much with Sass. 
   - I wanted to use it in this project just to cut out all the repetitiveness I have in my CSS files, like defining colors all over again, repeating the sizes of the elements, etc... 
   - The more I learned and heard about SCSS, the more I knew it was something I desperately needed. The variables, mixins and functions seemed like a perfect remedy to my ill css. 
   
3. Good ol' vanilla Javascript
   - Despite the jQuery's simplicity, I wanted to create the dynamic features of this page in the vanilla javascript.
   - I wanted to explore some potential design patterns such as : Module Revealing pattern, Inheritance, Constructor Pattern, etc...
   - I needed to brush up on my OOP skills withing JavaScript, so if you like jQuery, I'm sorry but you won't find any here.
   - But if you're into JavaScript design patterns, please feel free to comment & suggest some improvements!
4. Bootstrap
5. A shit ton of investigation
